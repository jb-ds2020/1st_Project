This repository includes the results of my first data science project during my data science bootcamp at neuefische in Hamburg. 

This project includes work with the complete data science lifecycle on a dataset. The given dataset is the King County House dataset, which includes sales in the King County Area from Mai 2014 to End of May 2015. My task in this project is to figure out at least 3 recommendations for buyers or sellers based on the given dataset.
